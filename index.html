			<p>
				Hello! Welcome to my (<s>retired</s> unretired?) academic homepage.
				I am currently doing various fun things at <a href="https://cartesia.ai/">Cartesia AI</a>.
				Previously, I did my undergraduate degree (class of 2024) in the 
				Computer Science and Molecular Biology program (Course 6-7) at MIT.
			</p>
			<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>
			<p>
				Currently, I mostly work on improving the models at Cartesia via fundamental modeling primitives.
				See some of our work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07955">hierarchical models</a> 
				as an example of such work.
				I am also interested in better representations of sequence data.
			</p>
			<p>
				More generally, I am interested in developing novel solutions to pressing problems, 
				particularly via the development of new technologies (both computational and social).
				Some (non-AI) directions I am particularly interested in
				include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevention and treatment of infectious disease</li>
                    <li>Better methods to understand molecular mechanisms of cells</li>
                    <li>Digital tools to enhance civic participation in democracies</li>
                    <li>Strategies to mitigate climate change</li>
                    <li>Designing healthier social networks</li>
                </ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				While at MIT, I worked with 
				<a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/ghaffari/">Mohsen Ghaffari</a> (MIT CSAIL),
				<a href="https://people.lids.mit.edu/yp/homepage/">Yury Polyanskiy</a> (MIT LIDS),
				and 
				<a href="https://www.wangxiaolab.org">Xiao Wang</a> (Broad Institute).
				Over Summer 2024, I worked with <a href="https://0xparc.org/">0xPARC</a>, an applied cryptography research organization.	
			</p>
			<h3 id="contests">Contests</h3>
			<p>
				In high school I participated in various national and international math and CS olympiads (I was at the USA's IOI training camp in 2017, the IMO training camp in 2017-2019, and on the IMO team in 2019).
				Nowadays, I help write problems and do various logistical tasks involved with running these competitions.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe that contests are a great way to develop problem-solving skills, meet other brilliant people, 
				and explore interests in various fields.
				On the other hand, I believe that they are primarily a means to an end, 
				and if you are currently a high-schooler doing these contests, I encourage you to also spend some time thinking more about 
				what you want to do in life (if you'd like to talk about this, feel free to reach out!).
			</p>
			<p>
				I have previously taught classes at the Math Olympiad Program (MOP), 
				primarily in combinatorics and combinatorial optimization.
				You can find the handouts below:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Black Magic: Induction as hammer. (<a href="files/magic.pdf">PDF</a>)</li>
				<li>Hallucination: Hidden structure in combinatorial processes. (<a href="files/hallucination.pdf">PDF</a>)</li>
				<li>Noodle Bar: Global optima via local structure. (<a href="files/noodlebar.pdf">PDF</a>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>I do not offer tutoring.</b>
				If you are a high schooler interested in math, I recommend reading higher math books.
				Personal favorites include Spivak's <i>Calculus</i>, Stein and Shakarchi's <i>Analysis</i> series (particularly Fourier and Complex),
				Howie's <i>Fields and Galois Theory</i>, and Marcus's <i>Number Fields</i>.
				Axler's <i>Linear Algebra Done Right</i> is also good, but if you are planning on being anything
				other than an algebraist, consider also reading Treil's <i>Linear Algebra Done Wrong</i>.

                While at MIT, I was a projectionist for the <a href="http://lsc.mit.edu/info/about.shtml">Lecture Series Committee</a>.
                I also played lots of tractor, and took a bunch of classes in various departments. Personal favorites include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fundamentals of Experimental Molecular Biology (7.002, S21)</li>
                    <li>Information Theory (6.441, F21)</li>
                    <li>Cell Biology (7.06, F21)</li>
                    <li>The Long War Against Cancer (STS.049, F21)</li>
                    <li>Immunology (7.23, S22)</li>
                    <li>Operating Systems Engineering (6.039, F22)</li>
                    <li>Distributed Algorithms (6.852, F22)</li>
                    <li>Advanced Algorithms (6.854, F22)</li>
		    <li>Contemporary Chinese Society (SOCIOL1141, S23)</li>
                    <li>Global Chinese Cinemas (CMS.S92, F23)</li>
                    <li>The Making of Modern [European] Politics (GOV1171, S24)</li>
                </ul>
